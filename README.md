### Project Overview

This task focuses on **Swiggy**, a popular food delivery app, specifically the **Dineout section**.  
The original design felt **cluttered and inconsistent**, making it difficult for users to explore offers smoothly.  

The redesigned version emphasizes **clarity, hierarchy, and discoverability**, while maintaining Swiggy’s brand identity.

### Pain Points Identified

* **Cluttered Interface** – Too many banners and offers reduced readability.  
* **Weak Visual Hierarchy** – Discounts and key features were not highlighted enough.  
* **Limited Discoverability** – Important actions like *Book Table* or *Top Rated* were hidden.

### Design Improvements

* **Navigation & Filters**  
  - Added a *horizontal filter bar* (Near Me, Top Rated, Book Table, Vouchers, etc.) for quick access.  
  - Improved discoverability by bringing frequent actions upfront.  

* **Visual Hierarchy**  
  - Organized offers into *clear card layouts*.  
  - Used *larger images and bold headings* to highlight deals.  

* **Modern Layout**  
  - Applied *whitespace and balanced spacing* to reduce clutter.  
  - Introduced *rounded card designs* for a cleaner, modern feel.  

* **Typography & Colors**  
  - Better *contrast* between headings and descriptions.  
  - Discounts highlighted with *vibrant accent colors* for quick recognition.  

* **User Engagement**  
  - Added *personalized sections* like *Romantic dining out*.  
  - Made CTAs like *View Outlets* more prominent.

### Conclusion

The redesigned Swiggy **Dineout page** is:  

* *User-friendly* – Simplified navigation and filters.  
* *Visually engaging* – Stronger hierarchy and modern design.  
* *Conversion-focused* – Clear CTAs guide users to act.
